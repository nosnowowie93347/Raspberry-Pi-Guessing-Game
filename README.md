# Raspberry-Pi-Guessing-Game
This project uses the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi to control LEDs 
This program randomly generates a number between 0 and 100, and asks the user to guess the number.  
The user will enter a guess using the keyboard and the program will signal if the guess is too high, too low, or correct by blinking different LED lights:  
red LED if too high  
yellow LED if too low  
and green LED if correct.  
The program loops until the user guesses correctly or requests to stop the program.
